        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
              I am a mathematician specializing in applied probability, stochastic processes,
              and statistical inference. My research centers on self exciting point processes
              that model how past events change the chance of future events, with a particular focus
              on Hawkes type models that capture rhythmic or oscillatory clustering.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy working at the interface of theory, computation, and applications. On the
              theoretical side I study stability, ergodicity, and asymptotic properties of
              stochastic processes that underlie likelihood based inference. On the computational
              side I design efficient simulation and estimation algorithms in R, with careful attention to reproducibility and diagnostic tools that make
              models usable by others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Teaching and mentoring are equally important parts of my professional identity.
              I have substantial experience with gateway courses such as precalculus and
              calculus, as well as proof based and probability oriented courses. My classroom
              approach combines clear structure, active learning, and inclusive practices that
              support students from a wide range of backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p class="about-summary">
              I am actively seeking positions where I can contribute as a teacher scholar in
              mathematics, build an accessible research program in stochastic processes and
              event data, and involve students in meaningful projects.
