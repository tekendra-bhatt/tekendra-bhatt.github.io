          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            I am in the process of building a formal publication record. At present my work is 
            organized around two major projects that share a common theme:
            start from rigorous probabilistic theory, develop efficient computational tools, 
            and then validate methods on realistic data sets.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first project develops a complete likelihood based framework for an oscillatory
            Hawkes process, including asymptotic theory, Fisher information, and testing for
            sinusoidal modulation. The second project develops a general differential operator
            approach to analytic moment formulas for Hawkes processes with kernels that can be
            represented by linear differential equations with constant coefficients.

          <h2>Project 1 - Likelihood Theory for Oscillatory Hawkes Processes</h2>
          <p><strong>Status:</strong> Manuscript in preparation</p>

          <h3>Model and setting</h3>
          <p>
            This project studies a class of Hawkes processes with a sinusoidally modulated,
            exponentially decaying excitation kernel. The model includes both monotone and
            non monotone kernels as special cases and is driven by a constant baseline
            intensity together with a kernel that satisfies an appropriate stability condition.
            The same assumptions cover processes started at time zero and stationary processes
            that conceptually start at negative infinity.
          </p>

          <h3>Rigorous asymptotic theory for maximum likelihood</h3>
          <p>
            The first contribution is a rigorous treatment of consistency and asymptotic
            normality of maximum likelihood estimators for this family of Hawkes models. 
            A key step is to control the conditional intensity for both processes that start 
            at time zero and stationary processes that start at negative infinity, and to show 
            that their conditional intensities are asymptotically equivalent to that of the 
            stationary Hawkes process with the same kernel.
          </p>
          <p>
            I establish boundedness and asymptotic equivalence of these intensities under
            structural assumptions on the kernel that apply to an entire class of kernels,
            not only to the specific oscillating kernel I propose. This class can include
            monotone and non monotone kernels as long as they satisfy a stability criterion.
            These results then feed into a uniform law of large numbers for the log likelihood 
            and the derivation of asymptotic normality of the estimator.
          </p>

          <h3>Fisher information and estimation challenges</h3>
          <p>
            The second contribution is a detailed study of Fisher information and parameter
            estimation. I derive a closed form expression for the Fisher information matrix
            using Laplace transforms, together with an approximate analytic Fisher information
            for the proposed oscillatory kernel. I then compare these analytic matrices with
            the observed Fisher information obtained from simulated data and show that the
            approximations are very accurate in realistic regimes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The model has five parameters. In particular, the frequency parameter and the
            parameter that governs the amplitude of oscillations are difficult to estimate in
            practice. I therefore design a multi stage estimation protocol that combines grid
            searches, profile likelihood, and local optimization. Simulations show that this
            procedure recovers all parameters with high precision and provides useful standard
            errors based on the Fisher information.
          </p>

          <h3>Testing for sinusoidal modulation</h3>
          <p>
            The third contribution is a test for the presence of sinusoidal modulation in the
            excitation kernel. In this setting the frequency parameter is a nuisance parameter
            that is not identified under the null hypothesis of no modulation. Following the
            approach of Davies, I construct a global score test based on the supremum of
            per frequency score statistics. The p value is approximated using the upcrossing 
            method for a chi squared process with one degree of freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through simulation studies I verify that the proposed test has good control of the
            type I error rate and useful power in relevant parameter regimes. An application 
            to high frequency financial data illustrates how the method can reveal intraday, 
            regime switching market dynamics that are not visible under a purely monotone
            excitation kernel.

          <h2>Project 2 - Analytic Moments for Hawkes Processes via Differential Operators</h2>
          <p><strong>Status:</strong> Technical manuscripts and follow up work in preparation</p>

          <h3>Sinusoidally modulated exponential kernel</h3>
          <p>
            The first part of this project presents a complete analytical framework for
            calculating the first four moments of a linear Hawkes process with a sinusoidally
            modulated, exponentially decaying kernel. Starting from the branching process
            representation, I derive a Volterra integral equation for the cluster probability
            generating function. By repeatedly differentiating the generating function, I obtain
            a recursive system of Volterra equations for functions related to factorial moments
            of cluster sizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then introduce a differential operator method that converts this system of
            integral equations into a recursive system of third order linear ordinary differential
            equations with constant coefficients. I prove that the corresponding characteristic
            equation has one real root and a pair of complex conjugate roots for all physically
            relevant parameter values. Finally, I give a detailed, step by step solution strategy
            for these equations, including an explicit derivation of the particular solution for
            the second order case and a complete pathway to the analytic moment formulas.
          </p>

          <h3>Erlang-2 kernel and generalization</h3>
          <p>
            The second part of the project applies this differential operator framework to a
            Hawkes process with an Erlang 2 excitation kernel. Starting from the recursive
            Volterra equations for derivatives of the cluster generating function, I identify
            a minimal annihilating differential operator for the Erlang 2 kernel and compute
            the associated convolution transform operator.
          </p>
          <p>
            This leads to a second order ordinary differential operator that governs all
            factorial moment densities. I solve the resulting ordinary differential equation
            for the first moment density explicitly and obtain a closed form expression for
            the expected event count. I then outline the construction of the forcing term for
            the second moment density and the corresponding particular solution, making clear
            the role of resonance when the forcing shares exponents with the homogeneous
            solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main idea is not tied to these specific kernels. The method can be applied
            to any Hawkes process whose kernel can be represented by a differential equation
            with constant coefficients. This creates a unified and systematic route to analytic
            or semi analytic moment formulas for a broad class of Hawkes models.

          <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
          <p>
            Together these projects aim to provide a coherent toolkit for Hawkes processes
            that combines rigorous asymptotic theory, analytic formulas for dependence
            structure, and carefully designed computational methods. My goal is to develop
            these results into a sequence of research articles that are accessible to applied
            probabilists and practitioners, and that support student projects at both the
            undergraduate and graduate level.
