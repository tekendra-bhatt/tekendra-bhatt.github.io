          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            I am in the process of building a formal publication record. At present my work is 
            organized around two major projects that share a common theme:
            start from rigorous probabilistic theory, develop efficient computational tools, 
            and then validate methods on realistic data sets.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first project develops a complete likelihood based framework for an oscillatory
            Hawkes process, including asymptotic theory, Fisher information, and testing for
            sinusoidal modulation. The second project develops a general differential operator
            approach to analytic moment formulas for Hawkes processes with kernels that can be
            represented by linear differential equations with constant coefficients.

          <h2>Project 1 - Likelihood Theory for Oscillatory Hawkes Processes</h2>
          <p><strong>Status:</strong> Manuscript in preparation</p>

          <h3>General framework for Hawkes maximum likelihood</h3>
          <p>
            This project begins with a general study of consistency and asymptotic normality of
            maximum likelihood estimators for parametric Hawkes processes with a nonnegative
            excitation kernel g(t; θ<sub>g</sub>) 1{t ≥ 0}. The analysis explicitly distinguishes the
            stationary Hawkes process N<sup>*</sup><sub>t</sub>, defined on the whole real line, and the
            asymptotically stationary process N<sub>t</sub>, defined on [0, ∞), with associated
            intensities λ<sup>*</sup><sub>t,θ</sub> and λ<sub>t,θ</sub>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under compactness, identifiability, and integrability assumptions (A1 to A4), I establish
            uniform L<sup>p</sup> bounds for the intensities and for their first and second order
            derivatives with respect to the parameters. A key result is an asymptotic equivalence
            statement
            <em>sup</em><sub>θ∈Θ</sub> ∥λ<sub>t,θ</sub> − λ<sup>*</sup><sub>t,θ</sub>∥<sub>p</sub> → 0 as t → ∞,
            with analogous convergence for the derivatives. The proofs combine Hölder, Jensen, and
            Minkowski inequalities with martingale bounds for compensated counting measures and
            kernel dominated integrability conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I further show mixing and ergodicity of the stationary intensity process λ<sup>*</sup><sub>t</sub>
            for bounded test functions and extend ergodicity to classes of functions with
            polynomial growth under moment conditions. This yields time average laws of large
            numbers that hold uniformly over the parameter space Θ. These ingredients provide
            exactly the regularity needed for maximum likelihood consistency and a quadratic
            expansion of the log likelihood leading to asymptotic normality with the usual
            Fisher information limit. Importantly, this framework is not restricted to a single
            kernel. It applies to any nonnegative kernel that satisfies the regularity conditions,
            so it covers a broad class of monotone and non monotone excitation functions.
          </p>

          <h3>Model and oscillatory setting</h3>
          <p>
            Within this general framework I focus on a family of Hawkes processes with a
            sinusoidally modulated, exponentially decaying excitation kernel. The model includes
            both monotone and non monotone kernels as special cases and is driven by a constant
            baseline intensity together with a kernel that satisfies an appropriate stability
            condition. The same assumptions cover processes started at time zero and stationary
            processes that conceptually start at negative infinity.
          </p>

          <h3>Fisher information and estimation challenges</h3>
          <p>
            A second major component of the project is a detailed study of Fisher information and
            parameter estimation for this oscillatory Hawkes family. I derive a closed form
            expression for the Fisher information matrix using Laplace transforms, together with
            an approximate analytic Fisher information for the proposed oscillating kernel. I then
            compare these analytic matrices with the observed Fisher information obtained from
            simulated data and show that the approximations are very accurate in realistic
            regimes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The model has five parameters. In particular, the frequency parameter and the
            parameter that controls the amplitude of oscillations are difficult to estimate in
            practice. I therefore design a multi stage estimation protocol that combines coarse
            searches over frequency, profile likelihood, and local optimization. Simulations show
            that this procedure recovers all parameters with high precision and provides useful
            standard errors based on the Fisher information.
          </p>

          <h3>Testing for sinusoidal modulation</h3>
          <p>
            The third contribution is a test for the presence of sinusoidal modulation in the
            excitation kernel. In this setting the frequency parameter is a nuisance parameter
            that is not identified under the null hypothesis of no modulation. Following the
            approach of Davies, I construct a global score test based on the supremum of
            per frequency score statistics. The p value is approximated using the upcrossing
            method for a chi squared process with one degree of freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through simulation studies I verify that the proposed test has good control of the
            type I error rate and useful power in relevant parameter regimes. An application to
            high frequency financial data illustrates how the method can reveal intraday,
            regime switching market dynamics that are not visible under a purely monotone
            excitation kernel.

  <h2>Project 2 — A Differential-Operator Method for Analytical Moments of Hawkes Processes</h2>
  <p><strong>Status:</strong> Technical report and manuscript in preparation</p>

  <h3>A general method based on differential operators</h3>
  <p>
    This project develops a unified analytical framework for computing closed-form
    moments of linear Hawkes processes by transforming the usual recursive Volterra
    system for cluster factorial moment densities into a system of ordinary differential
    equations with constant coefficients. The method begins from the branching-process
    representation of a Hawkes cluster and the associated probability generating function
    (PGF). By repeatedly differentiating the PGF at zero, one obtains a hierarchy of coupled
    Volterra integral equations for the factorial moments. The core contribution is the
    identification of a <em>minimal annihilating differential operator</em> that eliminates the
    kernel from these convolution equations, converting each Volterra equation into a
    linear ODE of fixed order whose coefficients depend only on the kernel.
  </p>

  <p>
    This differential-operator reduction provides a general and tractable method applicable
    whenever the excitation kernel admits a finite-order linear differential equation with
    constant coefficients. This includes a large class of monotonic and non-monotonic
    kernels, far beyond the standard exponential family. Compared with classical
    approaches using infinitesimal generators, martingale methods, or the multi-step
    expansion techniques of Cui, Hawkes, and Yi
    <span class="file-citation">:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</span>,
    the proposed method avoids heavy stochastic machinery and replaces it with a single,
    systematically constructed ODE.
  </p>

  <h3>Applications to exponential, gamma, and sinusoidally modulated kernels</h3>
  <p>
    For the exponential kernel the method reproduces known closed-form moments,
    confirming correctness and serving as the base case in the hierarchy. For the gamma
    kernel the annihilating operator becomes second-order, leading to a recursive pair of
    ODEs for the first two factorial moment densities. Solving these yields explicit
    formulas for the mean event count and a transparent pathway toward higher-order
    moments. This provides a more direct alternative to PGF-based or generator-based
    derivations in the literature.
  </p>

  <p>
    The method handles kernels with oscillation or modulation in a natural way.
    For the proposed sinusoidally modulated, exponentially decaying kernel—non-monotonic
    by construction—the annihilating differential operator becomes third-order, with one
    real and a complex conjugate pair of characteristic roots. This structure controls the
    form of both the homogeneous and particular solutions. I give a full derivation of the
    first four moments, including an explicit formula for the forcing term that appears in
    the second-moment equation and a careful treatment of resonance when the forcing
    shares exponents with the homogeneous solution. The resulting moment formulas
    capture the oscillatory behavior of the model in closed form.
  </p>

  <h3>Extension to kernels with higher-order structure (Erlang-2 and beyond)</h3>
  <p>
    The same differential-operator framework applies to excitation kernels that correspond
    to higher-order linear ODEs. I illustrate this by working out the Erlang-2 kernel,
    identifying the appropriate annihilating operator, computing the convolution transform,
    and deriving the ODE governing the first factorial moment. This leads to a closed
    form for the mean count E[N<sub>T</sub>] and provides a clear recipe for constructing the
    forcing term in the second-moment equation. The structure of the derivation shows
    how resonance and root multiplicity influence the particular solution.
  </p>

  <h3>General significance</h3>
  <p>
    Overall this project introduces a generic, algebraically driven method for obtaining
    analytical moments of Hawkes processes across a broad class of both monotonic and
    non-monotonic kernels. Its strength lies in reducing a potentially complicated
    probabilistic problem to <em>a single linear differential equation with constant
    coefficients</em>, making the approach simple to implement and extensible to many
    kernel families used in applications. The framework complements and simplifies
    existing methods and provides the analytic foundation needed for later developments
    in likelihood theory and model comparison.

          <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
          <p>
            Together these projects aim to provide a coherent toolkit for Hawkes processes
            that combines rigorous asymptotic theory, analytic formulas for dependence
            structure, and carefully designed computational methods. My goal is to develop
            these results into a sequence of research articles that are accessible to applied
            probabilists and practitioners, and that support student projects at both the
            undergraduate and graduate level.
