      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        I am in the early stages of building a formal publication record. At present my work is
        organized around two major projects that share a common theme: begin with rigorous
        probabilistic theory, design computational tools that reflect that theory, and then
        check performance on realistic data sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first project develops a likelihood based framework for parametric Hawkes processes,
        with particular attention to an oscillatory Hawkes model. It covers asymptotic properties
        of maximum likelihood estimators, Fisher information, and testing for sinusoidal
        modulation in the excitation kernel. The second project introduces a general differential
        operator approach to analytic moment formulas for Hawkes processes whose kernels admit
        a linear differential representation with constant coefficients, covering both monotonic
        and non monotonic examples.

  <h2>Project 1 - Likelihood Theory for Oscillatory and General Hawkes Processes</h2>
  <p><strong>Status:</strong> Manuscript in preparation</p>

  <h3>General asymptotic framework for Hawkes maximum likelihood</h3>
  <p>
    This project develops a general framework for maximum likelihood inference in parametric
    Hawkes processes with nonnegative excitation kernels. I distinguish carefully between a
    stationary Hawkes process defined on the whole real line and an asymptotically stationary
    process observed on a finite horizon, and study their associated conditional intensities
    as functions of the parameter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Under natural compactness, identifiability, and integrability conditions, I obtain
    regularity results for these intensities and their parameter derivatives and show that,
    as the observation window grows, the finite horizon intensity becomes asymptotically
    equivalent to the stationary intensity uniformly over the parameter space. This leads
    to laws of large numbers and central limit behavior for the log likelihood and its
    derivatives and yields consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood
    estimator with the usual Fisher information limit. The assumptions are stated directly
    in terms of the kernel, so the results apply to a broad class of Hawkes models, not
    only to the specific oscillatory form considered later.
  </p>

  <h3>Oscillatory Hawkes model and Fisher information</h3>
  <p>
    Within this general setting I focus on a Hawkes model with a sinusoidally modulated,
    exponentially decaying excitation kernel. The model has five parameters, including a
    frequency parameter and an amplitude parameter that control the oscillatory structure.
    I study the Fisher information matrix for this family, derive closed form expressions
    in terms of transforms of the kernel, and construct accurate analytic approximations
    that agree closely with observed information computed from simulated data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because the oscillatory parameters are challenging to estimate, I design a multi stage
    estimation procedure that combines coarse frequency exploration with local likelihood
    optimization. Simulation experiments show that this protocol can recover the full
    parameter vector with high precision in realistic sample sizes and delivers reliable
    standard errors based on the Fisher information.
  </p>

  <h3>Testing for sinusoidal modulation</h3>
  <p>
    A third component of the project is a test for the presence of sinusoidal modulation in
    the excitation kernel. In this problem the frequency parameter is a nuisance parameter
    that is not identified under the null hypothesis of no modulation. Adapting an approach
    due to Davies, I construct a global score type statistic based on the supremum of
    frequency specific scores and approximate its distribution using an upcrossing based
    p value calculation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Simulation studies indicate that the test has good size and power properties across a
    range of scenarios. An application to high frequency financial data illustrates how
    the oscillatory model and the associated test can reveal intraday patterns and
    regime switching behavior that are not captured by monotone kernels alone.

      <h2>Project 2 - Analytic Moments for Hawkes Processes via Differential Operators</h2>
      <p><strong>Status:</strong> Technical manuscripts and follow up work in preparation</p>

      <h3>A general differential operator framework</h3>
      <p>
        In this project I develop a general differential operator framework for computing
        analytical moments of linear Hawkes processes. The idea is to work at the level of
        cluster factorial moments and to encode the effect of the excitation kernel through
        a linear differential operator with constant coefficients. This reduces the moment
        problem to solving a fixed order ordinary differential equation whose structure
        depends only on the kernel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The method applies whenever the kernel admits a finite order linear differential
        representation, which covers a broad class of monotonic and non monotonic kernels.
        In contrast to some existing approaches for moment calculations in Hawkes processes,
        the framework avoids heavy machinery and keeps the analysis anchored to a single,
        carefully chosen differential operator.
      </p>

      <h3>Applications to exponential, gamma, and oscillatory kernels</h3>
      <p>
        I first validate the framework on the classical exponential kernel, where it recovers
        known moment formulas. I then extend the analysis to gamma type kernels, and obtain 
        closed form expressions for the mean event count and
        a structured route toward higher order moments. This highlights how the same
        operator based viewpoint can accommodate kernels with richer temporal structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The method is then applied to the sinusoidally modulated, exponentially decaying
        kernel that appears in my oscillatory Hawkes model. In this setting the associated
        operator naturally reflects the oscillatory behavior of the kernel, and the resulting
        moment expressions capture both decay and oscillation in a transparent way. The
        framework provides consistent treatment of exponential, gamma, and oscillatory
        cases within a single analytic toolkit.
      </p>

      <h3>Scope and significance</h3>
      <p>
        The main contribution of this project is to show that many Hawkes kernels used in
        applications, including both monotonic and non monotonic examples, can be handled
        by the same differential operator approach. Compared with classical
        approaches using infinitesimal generators, martingale methods, or the multi-step
        expansion techniques, the proposed method avoids heavy stochastic machinery and 
        replaces it with a single, systematically constructed ODE. This yields a generic pathway to
        analytical or semi analytical moment expressions that is conceptually simple,
        flexible, and well suited for further work on dependence structure, model
        comparison, and diagnostic tools for Hawkes processes.

          <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
          <p>
            Together these projects aim to provide a coherent toolkit for Hawkes processes
            that combines rigorous asymptotic theory, analytic formulas for dependence
            structure, and carefully designed computational methods. My goal is to develop
            these results into a sequence of research articles that are accessible to applied
            probabilists and practitioners, and that support student projects at both the
            undergraduate and graduate level.
