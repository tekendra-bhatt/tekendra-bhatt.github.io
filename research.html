          <p>
            My work lies in probability, stochastic processes, and statistical inference with
            a focus on self exciting point processes. I am especially interested in models that
            describe how events accumulate in time when each event can trigger further activity.

          <h2>Hawkes Processes and Their Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            Hawkes processes model events that tend to cluster in time. Each event increases the
            future intensity through a kernel function. This simple idea has made Hawkes models
            a standard tool for high frequency events in many fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            Classical models usually impose kernels that are positive and decaying. This captures
            basic self excitation but prevents behavior such as rebounds, damped oscillations, or
            temporary suppression followed by recovery. Data from financial markets, biological
            systems, and social activity often show patterns that are richer than monotone decay.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, inference for extended kernels can be fragile if one works without a
            firm theoretical foundation. Questions of stability, identifiability, and
            asymptotics become more delicate once the kernel changes shape.

          <h2>My Contributions</h2>

          <h3>1. Oscillatory and Damped Excitation Kernels</h3>
          <p>
            I construct families of kernels that produce oscillatory or rebound behavior while
            preserving the branching interpretation that makes Hawkes processes intuitive.
            Classical monotone kernels appear as special cases inside a larger family. This
            allows data driven comparison between simple and more expressive models.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Structural Assumptions and Stability</h3>
          <p>
            To ensure that the intensity process remains well behaved, I develop structural
            conditions that guarantee stability, boundedness, and ergodicity. These conditions
            are stated in a way that covers both monotone and oscillatory kernels, which keeps
            the theory unified and usable in practice.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Maximum Likelihood and Asymptotic Theory</h3>
          <p>
            I study maximum likelihood estimators for these extended Hawkes models and show that,
            under appropriate conditions, they are consistent and asymptotically normal. The
            argument combines uniform convergence of the log likelihood with ergodic properties
            of the intensity process. This creates a solid justification for likelihood based
            estimation in models that go beyond the classical setting.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Moments, Covariances, and Fisher Information</h3>
          <p>
            I derive analytic expressions or accurate approximations for means, covariance
            functions, and Fisher information matrices. These formulas provide insight into how
            parameters influence variability and dependence, and they lead to practical standard
            errors and diagnostic tools.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Computational Tools in R and Rcpp</h3>
          <p>
            I implement simulation, likelihood evaluation, gradient based optimization, and
            diagnostic plots in R with performance critical components in C++ using Rcpp. The
            code is organized to be modular and reproducible, making it easier for others to
            adapt the framework to new data sets and applications.
          </p>

          <h3>6. Applications and Student Focused Projects</h3>
          <p>
            I apply these models to realistic event data sets, comparing oscillatory and classical
            Hawkes models by fit and predictive performance. I also design case studies that can
            be used for undergraduate projects or capstone experiences where students learn both
            the probabilistic ideas and the computational workflow for event data.
