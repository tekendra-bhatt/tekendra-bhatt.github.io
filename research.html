          <p>
            My work lies in probability, stochastic processes, and statistical inference with
            a focus on self exciting point processes. I am especially interested in models that
            describe how events accumulate in time when each event can trigger further activity.

          <h2>Hawkes Processes and Their Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            Hawkes processes model events that tend to cluster in time. Each event increases the
            future intensity through a kernel function. This simple idea has made Hawkes models
            a standard tool for high frequency events in many fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            Classical models usually impose kernels that are positive and decaying. This captures
            basic self excitation but prevents behavior such as rebounds, damped oscillations, or
            temporary suppression followed by recovery. Data from financial markets, biological
            systems, and social activity often show patterns that are richer than monotone decay.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, inference for extended kernels can be fragile if one works without a
            firm theoretical foundation. Questions of stability, identifiability, and
            asymptotics become more delicate once the kernel changes shape.

          <h2>My Contributions</h2>

          <h3>1. Oscillatory and Damped Excitation Kernels</h3>
          <p>
            I construct families of kernels that produce oscillatory or rebound behavior while
            preserving the branching interpretation that makes Hawkes processes intuitive.
            Classical monotone kernels appear as special cases inside a larger family. This
            allows data driven comparison between simple and more expressive models.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Structural Assumptions and Stability</h3>
          <p>
            To ensure that the intensity process remains well behaved, I develop structural
            conditions that guarantee stability, boundedness, and ergodicity. These conditions
            are stated in a way that covers both monotone and oscillatory kernels, which keeps
            the theory unified and usable in practice.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Maximum Likelihood and Asymptotic Theory</h3>
          <p>
            I study maximum likelihood estimators for these extended Hawkes models and show that,
            under appropriate conditions, they are consistent and asymptotically normal. The
            argument combines uniform convergence of the log likelihood with ergodic properties
            of the intensity process. This creates a solid justification for likelihood based
            estimation in models that go beyond the classical setting.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Moments, Covariances, and Fisher Information</h3>
          <p>
            I derive analytic expressions or accurate approximations for means, covariance
            functions, and Fisher information matrices. These formulas provide insight into how
            parameters influence variability and dependence, and they lead to practical standard
            errors and diagnostic tools.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Computational Tools in R </h3>
          <p>
            I implement simulation, likelihood evaluation, gradient based optimization, and
            diagnostic plots in. Thecode is organized to be modular and reproducible, making 
            it easier for others to adapt the framework to new data sets and applications.
          </p>

                    <h3>6. Applications and Student Projects</h3>
          <p>
            I apply these models to realistic event data sets, comparing oscillatory and classical
            Hawkes models by fit, predictive performance, and interpretability. A typical project
            cycle begins with a rigorous probabilistic formulation, continues with careful
            computation and simulation in R and C plus plus, and finishes with an application to
            real data where the model assumptions are checked and refined.
          </p>
          <p>
            This structure supports a range of projects for both undergraduate and graduate
            students. At the introductory level, students explore self exciting behavior through
            simulation and visualization. At the intermediate level, students fit and critique
            models for real event data, learning how theory guides practical choices. At the
            advanced level, graduate students can work on individual pieces of the theoretical
            or computational program, such as proving specific limit results for a family of
            kernels or implementing and benchmarking new estimation routines.

          <h2>Future Directions</h2>
          <p>
            My long term research plan is to deepen the theory of Hawkes type models and to place
            them in a broader landscape of stochastic processes that describe event driven and
            continuous time phenomena. The guiding principle is to move repeatedly through a
            cycle of rigorous theory, efficient computation, and validation on real systems.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Develop sharper probabilistic results for oscillatory Hawkes processes, including
              limit theorems, rates of mixing, and refined stability and approximation properties.
            </li>
            <li>
              Study efficiency and robustness of inference procedures, such as likelihood based,
              moment based, and semiparametric methods, with a focus on finite sample performance
              for realistically sized data sets.
            </li>
            <li>
              Extend the framework to multivariate, spatial, and marked settings where Hawkes
              dynamics interact with other stochastic structures, for example queueing models,
              renewal processes, or diffusions driven by self exciting intensities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Explore related classes of stochastic processes that share some features with
              Hawkes models, such as self correcting and inhibitory processes, and understand
              when each family is most appropriate for modeling a given system.
            </li>
            <li>
              Build open source software that implements these ideas in a modular way, so that
              both researchers and students can experiment with new kernels, estimators, and
              diagnostics without rebuilding the core tools from scratch.
