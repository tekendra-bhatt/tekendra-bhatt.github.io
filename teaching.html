          <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            My teaching is guided by four principles: articulation, engagement, inclusion, and
            growth. They shape how I design courses, run class meetings, and work with students
            in both in person and fully online formats.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Articulation.</strong>
              New ideas are introduced through approachable questions and examples before we move
              to formal definitions and proofs. Each class begins with a short overview and ends
              with a summary so students see how pieces fit together.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Engagement.</strong>
              Students learn mathematics by doing mathematics. I use think–pair–share, small group
              work at the board, and targeted practice so that students regularly explain ideas,
              compare strategies, and receive feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Inclusion.</strong>
              I aim to build classrooms where it is safe to ask questions and admit confusion.
              I invite participation in multiple ways: speaking in class, writing, online
              discussion, polls, and one–to–one meetings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Growth.</strong>
              Assessment is organized to encourage improvement rather than one–time judgment.
              Frequent low–stakes checks, clear rubrics, and opportunities to correct mistakes
              help students see progress and adjust their study strategies.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The modality changes tools, not goals. In person courses emphasize board work and
            group problem sessions; online courses use structured modules, discussion forums, and
            carefully proctored assessments, while keeping the same emphasis on clarity and
            interaction.

              <strong>Structured course design.</strong>
              Weekly modules with checklists, goals, and resources help students organize their
              work and reduce uncertainty about expectations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Active learning.</strong>
              Class time is regularly used for guided problem solving, small group discussions,
              and board work where students compare reasoning and strategies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Retrieval and spaced practice.</strong>
              Short warm–up problems, mixed review questions, and cumulative quizzes encourage
              regular review of important ideas.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Early and proactive support.</strong>
              I monitor participation and early assessments and reach out to students who may be
              falling behind, helping them connect with office hours and other resources.

              <strong>Purposeful technology.</strong>
              Tools such as Canvas, WebAssign, Desmos, and GeoGebra are used to support
              conceptual understanding and feedback, not to overwhelm students with platforms.

          <h2>Mentoring and Student Projects</h2>
          <p>
            My research on Hawkes processes and related stochastic models provides a natural
            pipeline for student projects that moves from rigorous theory, to computation, to
            real or realistically simulated data.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Introductory and intermediate projects.</strong>
              Students simulate Poisson and self–exciting processes, visualize clustering, and
              fit simple models to time-stamped data using R, gaining intuition about randomness
              in time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advanced undergraduate projects.</strong>
              Students work with extended Hawkes models, compare different excitation kernels on
              data, and interpret parameter estimates in the context of an application area such
              as finance, reliability, or environmental events.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Graduate projects.</strong>
              Students take on focused pieces of the theory or computation, such as proving
              specific limit properties for a class of kernels, analyzing efficiency of an
              estimator, or implementing and benchmarking new algorithms for simulation or
              maximum likelihood.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In each case I try to connect the level of mathematical rigor to the student’s
            background while keeping the full story visible: from theoretical formulation, to
            code, to interpretation in a real world setting.
