          <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            My teaching is guided by four principles: articulation, engagement, inclusion, and
            growth. Together they shape how I design courses, run class meetings, and interact
            with students.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Articulation.</strong> Concepts are introduced through clear questions,
              simple examples, and intuitive explanations before moving to formal language and
              proofs. Each class session begins with a short overview of goals and ends with a
              brief recap so students see the structure of the course.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Engagement.</strong> Students learn mathematics by doing it. I use think
              pair share, small group board work, and targeted practice problems so that students
              regularly explain ideas to peers, not just listen to lectures.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Inclusion.</strong> I work to create an environment where it is safe to ask
              questions and admit confusion. I encourage multiple forms of participation, such as
              speaking in class, writing responses, using discussion boards, or visiting office
              hours.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Growth.</strong> Assessment is designed to support improvement. I rely on
              frequent low stakes quizzes or checks, transparent rubrics, and feedback that
              separates conceptual understanding from algebraic or computational slips.

          <h2>Courses and Experience</h2>
          <p>
            I have taught or supported instruction across the undergraduate curriculum. Exact
            course titles vary by institution, but representative courses include:

                <li>Precalculus</li>
                <li>College Algebra</li>

            My roles have included instructor of record, recitation leader, grader, and tutoring
            in a mathematics lab setting. I am comfortable with both face to face and fully online
            teaching and with integrating online homework systems into structured weekly modules.

          <h2>Classroom Practices</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Structured course shells.</strong> Each course uses a clear weekly
              structure with checklists, learning targets, and organized resources so students
              always know what to work on next.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Active problem sessions.</strong> I dedicate regular time to guided
              problem solving where students work in small groups, share solutions on the board,
              and critique different approaches.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Retrieval and spaced practice.</strong> Short warm up problems at the
              beginning of class and mixed review questions encourage students to revisit key
              concepts regularly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Early outreach.</strong> I monitor participation and early assessments to
              identify students who may be struggling, then follow up with individualized emails
              and suggestions for office hours and study strategies.

          <h2>Mentoring and Undergraduate Projects</h2>
          <p>
            I design project ideas that let undergraduates experience aspects of research while
            staying closely connected to course content. Examples include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Simulation projects that compare Poisson processes, classical Hawkes models, and
              oscillatory versions on synthetic data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Data projects where students analyze real time stamped data and fit simple event
              models, interpreting parameters in the context of the application.
            </li>
            <li>
              Small reading and presentation projects in real analysis or probability that build
              skill in mathematical communication.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These experiences prepare students for internships, further study, and mathematically
            intensive careers while integrating naturally into the curriculum.
