          <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            My teaching is guided by four principles: articulation, engagement, inclusion, and
            growth. They shape how I design courses, run class meetings, and work with students
            in both in person and online settings.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Articulation.</strong>
              New ideas are introduced through approachable questions and examples before we move
              to formal definitions and proofs. Each class begins with a short overview and ends
              with a summary so students see how pieces fit together.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Engagement.</strong>
              Students learn mathematics by doing mathematics. I use think pair share, small group
              work at the board, and targeted practice so that students regularly explain ideas,
              compare strategies, and receive feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Inclusion.</strong>
              I aim to build classrooms where it is safe to ask questions and admit confusion.
              I invite participation in multiple ways: speaking in class, writing, online
              discussion, polls, and one on one meetings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Growth.</strong>
              Assessment is organized to encourage improvement rather than one time judgment.
              Frequent low stakes checks, clear rubrics, and opportunities to correct mistakes
              help students see progress and adjust their study strategies.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Whether I am teaching face to face, fully online, or in a hybrid format, these
            principles remain the same. The modality changes the tools, not the underlying goals
            of clarity, activity, and support.

            <li>
              <strong>Structured course design.</strong>
              Weekly modules with checklists, goals, and resources help students organize their
              work and reduce uncertainty about expectations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Active learning.</strong>
              Class time is regularly used for guided problem solving, small group discussions,
              and board work where students compare reasoning and strategies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Retrieval and spaced practice.</strong>
              Short warm up problems, mixed review questions, and cumulative quizzes encourage
              regular review of important ideas.

            <li>
              <strong>Early and proactive support.</strong>
              I monitor participation and early assessments and reach out to students who may be

              <strong>Technology with a purpose.</strong>
              Tools such as Canvas, WebAssign, Desmos, and GeoGebra are used to support
              conceptual understanding and feedback, not to overwhelm students with platforms.

          <h2>Mentoring and Student Projects</h2>
          <p>
            My research on Hawkes processes and related stochastic models provides a natural
            pipeline for student projects. The typical pattern is:
            rigorous probabilistic formulation, computational exploration, and then application
            to real or realistically simulated data.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Introductory and intermediate projects.</strong>
              Students simulate Poisson and self exciting processes, visualize clustering,
              and fit simple models to time stamped data sets using R, gaining intuition about
              randomness in time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advanced undergraduate projects.</strong>
              Students work with extended Hawkes models, compare different kernels on data,
              and interpret parameter estimates in the context of an application area such as
              finance or reliability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Graduate projects.</strong>
              Students take on focused pieces of the theory or computation, such as proving
              specific limit properties for a family of kernels, studying efficiency of an
              estimator, or implementing and benchmarking new algorithms for simulation or
              maximum likelihood.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In each case I aim to connect the level of mathematical rigor to the student’s
            background while keeping the full story visible: from theory, to code, to real
            world interpretation.
